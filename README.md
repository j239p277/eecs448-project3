# Puck Yeah, baby!

Puck Yeah is a web based multiplayer air hockey game. To run Puck Yeah, you must have nodejs installed. To start the server, navigate to the Puck Yeah directory using the command line and type ```nodejs server.js``` or ```node server.js``` depending on your platform and nodejs version. Once the server is running, simply navigate to ```localhost:3000``` in a web browser (tested in and built for Google Chrome, but others may work) to begin playing.
